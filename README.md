This prototype provides a debugger server including the concrete debugger for graphical modeling languages. The debugger server connects with the [GLSP debugger framework](https://github.com/EderH/graphicalLSP).

Currently there exist debugger servers and their appropriate debuggers for the following modeling languages:
